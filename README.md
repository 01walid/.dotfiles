# 01walid's dotfiles

Feel at `$HOME`, these are my personal config files (a.k.a dot files), I manage them using [Gnu Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). 
Not everything is included yet, working on it.

## What am I using? 
MacOs and Arch Linux with: 

- Terminal: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) as a terminal multiplexer. 
- The zsh shell, with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for the shell prompt.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as a plugin manager.
- [Linux only] [qtile](http://www.qtile.org/), the tiling window manager.
